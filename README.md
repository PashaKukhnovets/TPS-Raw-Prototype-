# TPS-Raw-Prototype-
I did this project based on the tutorial from the book "Learning C# through Unity Game Development". In it, I did a lot in my own way, relying on my personal knowledge and on the documentation on the Internet. My own mechanics have also been added, such as sprinting, turning the camera with a computer mouse, shooting by raycasting and more.
